# .describe() function
-> used to see some useful descriptive statistics like mean, std, max etc.

# .resample() function
-> resample a time series to a different frequency
-> to convert daily data into monthly data or vice versa and so on 
-> need to specify which column to use and what kind of sample frequency we want
-> Example: if we want "DATE" column to be resampled with monthly frequency "M" and get the price at month-end
   then 
	df_btc_monthly = df_btc_price.resample('M', on='DATE').last()
